# Readable: A Simple Anonymous Content & Comments App

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React&Redux course. Per project specs, users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.



## To setup & run the project:

* first make sure you have the API server running locally; you can get it from [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).
* download or clone this repo
* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`


## Project Info:  

* This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app). 
* I used [Material Design for Bootstrap 4 (React version)](https://mdbootstrap.com/react/) for styling it.
* There's lots of room for improving the app; at this time I've tried to make sure requirements per the [project rubrics](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1017/view) are satisfied.


> Here are some of improvements I can think of:

> - add validation so that empty posts and comments don't get published.
> - add more sort options (asc, desc)
> - improve the user interface
> - add search functionality (on posts, comments, users, date range, categories as facets)
> - add user login functionality (registration, authentication, ...)
> - host the app on `Google Firebase` - including the `Express` server.
